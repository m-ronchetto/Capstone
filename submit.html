                        Dorothy Collins, who lives in Pine Lawn, said she worries about her grandchildren’s health when they visit her because of the poor air quality. Her grandson suffers from asthma, and she is afraid to let him play outside.

                        “It makes me feel bad because they have problems breathing when they are around, and I don't like to see them suffer,” Collins said.
