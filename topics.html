                    Air pollution contributes to premature death, heart attacks, aggravated asthma, and reduced lung function. St. Louis has been in violation of the federal health-based air standard for ozone since 1979.

                    There is no safe level of exposure to lead. Lead poisoning has been occurring much longer and the rates continue to be higher in the northern section of the city and southern along highway 55.

                <p>

                    Access to healthy food is associated with lower risk for obesity and other diet-related chronic diseases. Access to a car allows people to leave the food desert and shop at supermarkets and large grocery stores outside of their neighborhoods.
