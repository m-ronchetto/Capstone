                                        Dorothy Collins lives in Pine Lawn neighborhood in north St. Louis County. The area has high rates of air pollution and asthma-related hospitalizations. She said she worries about her grandchildren’s health when they visit her because of the poor air quality. Her grandson suffers from asthma, and she is afraid to let him play outside.

                                        “It makes me feel bad because they have problems breathing when they are around, and I don't like to see them suffer,” Collins said.

                                        Ms. Kaliah West is a current resident of University City, where she lives with her daughter and uncle. From 1 to 2 years of age, Kaliah’s daughter resided in North City with her grandmother while Kaliah was incarcerated. During that time, her daughter suffered from lead exposure, something Kaliah did not discover until her release.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Five years have passed since the exposure to dangerous conditions in the grandmother's home, and her daughter's blood lead levels have returned to normal. Kaliah reports that her daughter still experiences behavioral issues, a common side effect of lead exposure.

                                    <p>
                                        After Janice Rideout became the guardian of her 13- and 11-year old grandsons, she moved into a larger apartment in her Dutchtown neighborhood. She noticed water on the floor, and at first thought it was from the garbage disposal, which she knew had to be replaced. But then the water problem got a lot worse, and she traced the water back to the kitchen pantry. There was black mold all over the ceiling and a little on the walls.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Ms. Rideout told her landlord about the mold, but he didn’t
                                        find a roofer in his price range and didn’t fix the problem.
                                        She withheld her rent and called the City’s building
                                        inspector, which saw the mold and sent the landlord a
                                        citation. The landlord retaliated against her
                                        and got an emergency eviction order. When they went
                                        to court, the judge assigned a mediator, but the landlord
                                        refused to fix the mold problem and the meditation didn’t
                                        resolve things.

                                        Tonja Bulley is a resident of the Greater Ville neighborhood in St. Louis City. She grew up in the City then moved out to the County to raise her children. She relocated back to the City because rent is much more affordable. Ms. Bulley cares for her aunt who suffers from Alzheimer’s disease and works as a home health aide.

                                    <p>
                                        Recently, Ms. Bulley had to start using public transportation because she does not have a vehicle. What was previously a twenty-minute car ride to work now takes over an hour and requires three separate buses. Bus fare is costly and adds up. Often, Ms. Bulley asks family and friends for a ride but feels burdensome. However, she would rather catch a ride to the grocery store than shop at a local corner store.
